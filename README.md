# Native C++ Tetris

A fast, native Windows Tetris built with C++ and the Win32 API. No Raylib, no
engine, no asset pipeline to set up. Just build it and play.

The game has grown from a small practice project into a sharper arcade-style
Tetris with hold, ghost piece, spin clears, combo feedback, persistent best
score, and a dark pixel UI.

## Why It Feels Good

- Hold, ghost landing, and a three-piece next queue for planning ahead
- T-spin scoring plus custom L/J/I/S/Z style-spin clears
- Faster line-clear flash, combo feedback, level-up feedback, and best score
- Start, pause, restart, and game-over overlays
- Pixel-style font with compact Win32 rendering
- Lightweight sound cues for moves, drops, hold, rotate, clears, pause, and game over

## Controls

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Any key on READY | Start |
| Left / Right or A / D | Move |
| Down or S | Soft drop |
| Up or W | Rotate |
| Space | Hard drop |
| C or Shift | Hold |
| P or Esc | Pause |
| Any key while paused | Resume |
| R | Restart |
| Q | Quit |

## Scoring

| Action | Points |
| --- | --- |
| Soft drop | 1 per row |
| Hard drop | 2 per row |
| Line clear | 100 / 300 / 500 / 800 |
| T-spin clear | 800 / 1200 / 1600 |
| Style-spin clear | 400 / 700 / 1000 / 1200 |

Level increases every 10 cleared lines. The drop speed ramps up as the level
rises, and the best score is saved to `tetris_highscore.txt`.

## Build And Play

On Windows, open PowerShell in the project folder:

```powershell
.\build.bat
.\main.exe
```

Or build directly with MinGW-w64:

```powershell
g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra src\*.cpp -mwindows -lgdi32 -luser32 -o main.exe
.\main.exe
```

Or use CMake:

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
.\build\Release\main.exe
```

## Core Tests

The game rules are portable and can be tested without the Win32 window:

```bash
c++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -Isrc tests/core_tests.cpp src/block.cpp src/blocks.cpp src/game.cpp src/grid.cpp src/high_score.cpp src/position.cpp src/sound.cpp -o /tmp/tetris_core_tests
/tmp/tetris_core_tests
```

With CMake:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --target tetris_core_tests
ctest --test-dir build
```

## Project Map

```text
src/main.cpp        Win32 window, drawing, input, timers
src/game.cpp        Game rules, scoring, hold, spin detection
src/grid.cpp        Board storage and row clearing
src/high_score.cpp  Best-score file
src/sound.cpp       Tiny Windows beep cues, no-op elsewhere
tests/core_tests.cpp
```

CI runs the portable core tests on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows.
